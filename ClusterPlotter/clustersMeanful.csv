533682,Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers,28441174,Rex Nichols,"The infomation is good, but the structure of the course needs work. In particular the early portions of the course could use the most revision.Certain parts of the course feel like that they're dragging out certain concepts for too long. Basically brute forcing solutions in a rather long and confusing way, and approaches simply teaching bad programming practices.  When the previous concepts no longer handle the problem effectively a new concept should probably be introduced that smoothly tackles the problem. Its easier to understand abstract concepts, even more complicated ones, when they are applied to a situation that makes logical sense. Rather than trying to force lessons through an abitrary scenario that doesnt make much sense, which simply makes things confusing.",4.0,2019-03-09T13:30:16Z,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I blame Udemy for that. Its spamming for you to rate the course right at start and repeatedly does that..... in all honesty, while you are working on simple concepts at the beginning of the course, it is very good!Tim takes time explaining some simple concepts in depth (to a point you get really bored, but its a good thing)! However, when it gets to more advanced concepts you will actually need to know, its just skimmed through.Example: Tim will take time to explain indexing of arrays (arraylist) for entire lesson. You will get to know basic usage of arraylist with classes  like (String, Double, Integer etc.), but when it comes to a concept of using class YOU create in arraylist, that is just typed as a solution in a challenge with no explanation whatsoever.Advance use of constructors is also introduced as solution in challenges and you are left to figure out on your own what, why and how... and list goes on and on... I actually laughed really hard when I got to Cell Factories lesson and Tim said now that we know how to use CellFactory... He just typed it on screen, read to you out loud...Final word to people considering this course. I have no idea who this course is. Its for beginners who would like to stay beginners, cause if you want to learn anything more advanced, you will need to find another course and have this one as supplemental.",1.0,2018-12-06T09:04:08Z,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,

Por ejemplo: Numer Palindrome Quiz (Coding Exercise 14)Propuestas para mejorar:- Añadir ejemplos y concretar los enunciados de los Challenge. Por ejemplo:    - Section 65 - Inheritance Challenge Part 1: el requerimiento de implementar las clases vehículo y coches, tal y como aparece en el enunciado, no indica de forma efectiva los métodos que finalmente se ven en el enunciado.    - Section 74 - OOP Master Challenge Exercice: me resultó especialmente confuso el requerimiento de instanciar la Hamburger básica con nombre y precio... para después volverlo a calcular añadiendo los ingredientes extra (additions). Creo que lo habría visto a la primera con un par de ejemplos.e.g.: BaconBurger(meat Bacon, basePrice 3.7 ); PolloBurger(meat Chicken, basePrice 2.5 );- El instructor Goran Lochert debería dar respuestas más concretas a las preguntas de los alumnos.

533682,Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers,21811780,Muhammad Hasan,"I did not like the teaching style - the whole course is mostly based on coding examples and that takes up the most of the content length. I would expect to have appropriate lecture slides to clear up the concepts, possibly with related graphics and animation. The code examples should be minimalistic to just demo the current concept. Most of the examples are unnecessarily bloated, e.g. to demo the methods of Collection capability we don't need and theatre seat reservation example. Lots of times Oracle documentation pages are show - we can get those pages by googling it for that we don't need to take a course. Instead as I mentioned earlier I excepted lecture slides with easily digestible contents.Due to this course's tremendously  not useful structure it cannot be used as an effective reference material  at all though you get lifetime access to it - unless this course is restructured and redone as an effective one.Nevertheless, the instructors get a round of applause for putting their valuable time and effort to make the course contents to teach the course.",2.5,2018-10-11T19:15:50Z,,,,,,,True,,,,True,,,,,,

Thank you, Goran for your quick responses and support.I can imagine how much time and efforts you dedicated to this course. I definitely became more familiar with Java and very happy that I finally passed it. For whom this course: I think it's especially perfect for those who already has some knowledge and helps to fill out all gaps. If you are a total zero, you might quit very fast. But if you are familiar at least little bit with Java and have a very strong wish you may get till the end. I like: 1. Tim shows how the right code should look and he shows how to write  real programs. It's not that case where you use cats or dogs for examples2. I like the part about SceneBuilder, SQL, Server, Threads, DebuggerDon't like: 1. Some explanations would be easier to understand if it had more synonyms or vice verse be more laconic. When you repeat word Object or LinkedList or any other 5-7 times in one sentence despite on you are talking about different substances, brain just shuts down, I was rewinding the video, slowing it down, listening it with subtitles, but it just sometimes hard to get the idea. The manner of speech is total the manner of how you write the code)), when for the coding it's perfect, but for telling sounds overwhelming. 2. I would add more slides with graphics, not with just text, we all understand visualisation better and remember it for longer time. 3.

533682,Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers,18950370,Krzysztof Witalewski,"It should really be called introduction to programming and OOP with Java. Also, I really don't like how the examples are not suited to real-world applications.For example, why does the instructor insist to explain Classes with cars and fish, adding methods like move muscles which don't really do anything while the examples could just be simplified versions of something we could run into in real project like, say, a Product with name and price, IDiscountProduct interface which also have a discount field and related methods, and THEN we could have a Car as a class inheriting from Product, with model, make, mileage etc. as new fields to display, order by etc?Also, going along with the choice to use real world object examples approach to teaching OOP, I would appreciate some more well-thought examples which are easier to map to actual solutions. Like - why does a Room have a Lamp, a Rug and a Bed along with wall1, wall2, wall3 and wall4 rather than a list of Furniture items and a list of Wall items (maybe with a check if there are at least 4, but actually there are 3-walled triangular rooms and 1-walled round rooms)?Also, the lectures are really long not because there is so much in depth analysis, but rather because every 2-3 chapters we create new examples and new data structures from scratch. Why not follow a single project per course or course section, showing how presented language elements or technique can work with some established structures which we only need to type in once and then modify?Moreover, sometimes the chapter titles are a bit misleading, with something declared in the title actually being explained in adjacent chapters for the most part.The course also doesn't emphasize best practices enough. Like, with learning about Lists, the examples provide some deep insights into how they work (and that's a plus) but on the downside starting with how an ArrayList might be a plug-and-play replacement for nothing more than a resizable array, seems to miss the point of showing how to work with lists in production code and making use of them to create better code (which in my opinion would be to use thing like iterators at once and then discuss how things work internally). The same goes for creating MyIntClass (with setInt and getInt) to create a List of integers rather than going straight for List<Integer>.",2.5,2018-07-24T06:41:43Z,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Would prefer not to spend hours writing code that has no value which could be better spent expanding on the topic being discussed.   The JDBC section of the course is an example of this in action.   Many lessons are devoted to using String Builder to create SQL queries only to find out that that is not a good approach as it is susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.

533682,Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers,15309040,Kush Arora,"This is an extremely exhaustive course which should take a beginner at least 6 months to complete. I would recommend Balaguruswamy's JAVA or some other JAVA fundamentals book to be read first especially for absolute beginners. I was able to quickly grasp things because I have some back-ground in C++ and I also read a bit of what a class/ object is from the Oracle tutorials. In my opinion this 7 star course is very well supplemented by :-- a course-book like Head First Java (for a friendly and quick grasp of the big OOP concepts like polymorphism, etc.) -- Oracle JAVA tutorials -- in case some topic is not properly introduced or the student needs in-depth understanding then recommend to read the same in Head First Java or look it up online. Do not proceed until that point is clear. -- best way to do this course is to re-work each and every program that Tim is writing. In case you are a middle-level learner then maybe initial examples can be skipped. But as soon as you perceive complexity, do not wait for Tim to give you an exercise. Start coding right away. In case you are absolute beginner to programming then this course does proceed at a rate faster than you can cope with. My recommendation to proceed with these steps before you start this course:-- Do some mathematical level exercises based on JAVA such as print this or that star pattern. -- Same can be done in C or C++ but why to take the road on which you will not travel? -- Some examples: Print Fibonacci series till given number, 'n'. Print Newton's triangle. -- Sort an inputed list in ascending/ descending order. Try to write a program which solves an inputed Sudoku puzzle of the lowest complexity. -- Try to write a program to print a magic square. -- idea is that if you reach till this level then you are fully in command of 'if', 'for' and 'while' loop statements. These are the very basics of thinking like a computer. -- my recommendation would be to write the program on a piece of paper and literally dry-run it. I.e. your brain becomes the compiler and you run through each line of code following the control flow. That is how I learnt. Once you reach this complexity then read the beginning chapters of the ORACLE JAVA tutorials available at Oracle website. Understand what a class is and what an object is. What is state and behaviour. What are fields, etc. Just the basic grammar of Object Oriented Programming. Tip: sometimes you want to skip the boring text and look at animations or great explanations on YouTube in case the text-book theory is putting you to sleep. Whenever that happens a great strategy is to simply look for the topic on YouTube. Once you have reached to this level, that means that you very well know how conditional statements work and know what is meant by Class & Object. Now you are ready to take Tim's course. :) Thank you Tim. I cannot thank you enough.",5.0,2018-04-04T07:16:48Z,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once I had reached the threading part of this course I pretty much gave up on this course for months because the challenges were gone, the content was not discussed in a beginner friendly manner and the way that he would code things were just confusing in the sense.

In fact I went off in search of a picture on the Internet and found one that within seconds of seeing it understood what was being said. More visual aids are required rather than endless complicated speech. Also, some of the statements being typed are huge. This isn't a problem per-se and is typical when performing complex tasks.

533682,Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers,8935834,Cheung Wai Lok,"The single biggest shortcoming of this course is that the instructor tries to explain a very simple concept or logic using lengthy and unnecessary code. Whenever you are trying to demonstrate a concept to someone, you should make the code as short and simple as possible. In most of the cases, Tim can do it in few line of code, but he chose to write lengthy application. Very often, I get distracted by that. For instance, in the set and hashset  section, Tim should have said directly that set is simply just a generic list that forbids duplicated items, and demonstrated some of its basic methods and features using an extremely simple example. It can be done very clearly within few minutes. Instead, he wrote clumsy Heavenbody application, which is downright distracting and purposeless, even time-wasting. Tim should have demonstrated the concept/method first in the simplest way, then its common variation in usage (also in its simplest form), and finally provided an example of real world application.

533682,Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers,8921758,Adam Fields,"I think this is a great course for beginners looking to learn Java as well as object-oriented programming.If you are coming from another programming language, you may find the course a little boring though. I'm halfway through, and we have yet to build anything that resembles an app. Object oriented programming is about creating blocks (objects) and then building increasingly complex applications with those blocks. Thus far in the course, I haven't seen any examples of that. Some ideas for command line apps are: todo list, recipe list, hangman game, choose your own adventure game, mad libs game, various calculators (cash register, tip calculator), etc. My point is, the course could be a lot more engaging if you actually built things instead of listening about boolean operator precedence for hours. With that said, I've found it easier to listen to the first few minutes of each video then go to the official Oracle tutorial and teach myself the rest. I'll be sure to update this review once I finish the desktop application and web server parts of the course.

Tim does a great job at presenting content early on in an effective and engaging manner.The second half of the course does let it down a little in that explanations are difficult to follow at times and often felt rushed. Topics such as JavaFX, Databases/Sequel/ and Networks would have benefited by having their scope expanded or separated into separate courses and challenges interconnected. As is challenges are at the end of each section which works great for the first half, but for advanced topics makes it difficult to grasp as there is a lot of content to go through before reaching the challenges.  This often felt more difficult then it should have. Overall however a very good course and well worth investing time and money. Just a pity about the second half.  I do however recommend this course as being one of the best out there. Tim offers this course as a Masterclass and for the most part it lives up to expectations.

533682,Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers,6868830,Matt M,"I am really enjoying this course, it is probably one of the most quality online courses I've ever taken. I have studied C++ and Python on my own, both through books and online materials, so I was able to blow through the basics with ease. However, as a refresher of the topics in Java, I can say that Tim is very thorough in presenting all the topics, such that I feel that I would have no problem learning all the concepts if this were my first programming language. Tim is an exceptional teacher, and while some might find his pace a bit slow, I will say that I appreciate the slower pace due to how thorough he goes into teaching the subjects. He makes you feel very confident in understanding the material. And if you wanted to move a bit faster, you can always skip certain topics or even speed up the video. Any time I've had any questions during the course, due to the massive amount of students enrolled, I find I can easily look at the Q&A section for each video and find that someone has usually already asked the same question. You will also find that if you still need to ask a question, Tim is exceptionally responsive, and will respond to you within a day or two! But honestly my favorite part about the course is that he works to keep the course constantly updated (a HUGE PLUS in my book!), so that you never feel like you're learning outdated and/or irrelevant material. You'll also really appreciate the fact that his videos come in full 1080p High-Definition! I am also enrolled in Tim's Android course as well, and it's just as amazing. I'm most likely going to enroll in his Python Masterclass too, just because of how amazing he is at teaching material to you in such a way that you really feel like you grasp it.

I need a focus on writing code. Tim explains at a pace that 2x speed is intelligible but quick, and is constantly programming. He gives you reasonable problems to work through, and the best bit is if there's something too hard to get right now I can skip it and come back to it later.I have finished the inheritance part of the course in about a day or two, much better then the week it took my university program. I appreciate moving at my own pace and I appreciate the obvious effort Tim puts into his examples and lectures. He doesn't spend too much time on any one thing, he doesn't needlessly repeat himself and his voice is pleasant to listen to. As well the sub 20 minute lectures are great for concentration. Code along with the lecture, finish lecture, maybe make an extra class to fiddle with what he's explained, take a drink, zone out for 5 minutes, next lecture. I can do this for hours.If there was one thing, I would say give us more problems. But as it is the challenge to experience ratio is pretty good.

In fact, I was able to find a job as Java developer with the knowledge gained from this course, so I basically owe Mr. Buchalka my career - currently I've been working as Java/JavaScript developer for 7 months and counting :-)About this course: The lectures are constructed in a way so you get to understand what to do and why to do it. The only small downside for me was that some of the challenges were too abstract to understand what was it that the instructor actually wanted me to do, but maybe that's just me - and on the other hand it forces you to think abstractly, which is an important thing in programming. Furthermore, this was only problem for me at the beginning of the course, but as you learn and get better and better, you are able to come up with a solution relatively easy. So, to sum up, this course is worth every penny and I find Tim to be one of the best instructors here on Udemy. Don't get discouraged if you have problems at the beginning!

This course is perfect for students in computer science when he or she is in the beginning of learning about jsp and servlets. But for a professional developer the amount of learning is too low. For this case you should better buy a good book, that covers a lot of more informations and practical details for real java web application development. Anyway this course should be a little bit more complex in programming the database application (e.g. 3 tables in place of only one table, a real maven integration with videos and some video steps about bootstrap, pdf-export and maybe an very easily statistic output). Often as mentioned by others here before you loose time in creating files in the videos (please don't do this in each video). Overall his explanations are good, but for me sometimes i missing more relevent details.

Not all courses on Udemy are this excellent, and I'm already a great fan of his.Just one comment: Getting Eclipse and Tomcat work together on Linux took me more time than the first five sections combined - only because I installed Eclipse as a generic user and - for some reason - Tomcat as root. This was a BAD idea, folks, don't do it. Also do not use pre-packaged versions of your Linux distributions.

So many topics were not covered or not explained in depth.However, if you already know HTML, CSS, Javascript and MySQL and want to learn database-driven backend development with JSP, servlets and MySQL, then I strongly recommend the course as a starter course. The course focuses mainly on the  JSP, servlets and JDBC and not that much on everything else.I came into the course already knowing everything except for JSP, servlets and JDBC, so this wasn't a problem. I got what I wanted out of the course and am satisfied. I would recommend it to beginners who would want a brief introduction to full-stack development using JSP. But I would caution them to purchase another longer, and more comprehensive, full-stack web development course, for learning all the required HTML, CSS, Javascript and MySQL, in greater detail.

This course is suitable for both the beginners as well as the professionals.  If anyone looks for the career in the java technology, this is a MUST course.Long back I did a course on java 7 in NIIT(chennai). I spent 18K + 8K for training and certification. But over the time, I moved to front end technologies in which we got more projects. So, I wanted dust off my  java skills. I landed on this course that I never regret my decision.This course is really a gift at the cost of 640 INR.

358540,Java In-Depth: Become a Complete Java Engineer!,13086854,Haley Mnatzaganian,"This course is amazing! I haven't completed it yet and have been waiting to rate it, but after 90 lessons I'm still amazed at how well Dheeru has crafted this course and I have no complaints! I started this course coming from Ruby and with very little Java experience, but I feel confident that a person with no programming experience would still be able to be dangerous with Java after taking this course.Reasons why it's awesome:1. Great pace & clear explanations. Dheeru takes his time explaining each concept and gives great examples to make everything understandable. He has lots of demos and examples where he shows not only what a concept looks like in practice, but also what it looks like when something is implemented incorrectly, that way he can explain the error and give the student a chance to learn from that. He is also very clear - I have yet to finish a lesson and have any confusion about the topics he discussed (at least within the scope of what he discussed).2. Very in depth. Dheeru teaches not only the basic language syntax of Java (like how do I instantiate an array), but gives tons of information on more advanced topics like exception handling and multithreading, as well as information on broader (but still necessary and helpful) topics like how to use Eclipse and the basics of objected-oriented programming. He also makes a point to not just tell you how to do something, but to explain why it must be done that way, or to explain the inner workings of Java/JVM that affect certain design choices.3. Awesome student challenges. I have taken a few MOOC courses before, and usually any challenges designed for the student are very simplified and weren't actually challenging. Dheeru has designed challenges that force you to do more than just spit out memorized concepts, but require you to figure out how to combine & apply what you've learned in a given section. They are great opportunities to really practice what you've learned.4. Awesome teacher. Dheeru clearly knows what he is talking about - he is able to explain concepts well and also give a history of how certain aspects of the Java world have changed. He is very friendly and has clearly put a lot of effort into this course, and it shows!In summary, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Java.

Every topic is explain in the best way , so step by step. Example at university when they explain for the inheritance they explain at the same moment for the classes and for the interface ( so students that hear for the first time get confused). Here i notice that the teacher before explain the inheritance about classes and after about interface, so everything is made step by step in the best way.And what can i say about Generics :PGenerics before was my nightmare. I visit tons of websites, download tons of slides and the only one that i have seen that expail Generics in the easies way and in the best way was the videotutorial of this course.I wish to give to this course more than five but it is impossible.ps: i am shame that i haevn0t discover this course before and i am more than happy for the money that i have spend about this course.",5.0,2017-10-13T01:52:58Z,True,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,

This course is very well done. I bought it and expected it to be the normal Java course. But the lecturer is very good, and I am impressed with the way he has structured his build up of concepts. There is many important steps and logic behind Java that are often not taught on courses, except maybe at university or by one of the Oracle tuition courses. This is honestly the very best online Java video course on the market. Besides working as a professional Java developer I used to lecture for the University of South Africa on Maths which helps me appreciate how well structured this course is. I Initially was just looking for a brush up on the basics again course. After a very short while I realized Java In-Depth course offers far more than that. I am impressed. Even though I have 8 years development experience, I have seen (and unfortunately) been part of writing problematic solutions. Many developers have. You start writing solutions, and skip best practises to catch up time, and at the end of the project you end up with a huge technical debt that delays your DTI.

Coming from other programming languages into Java, the use of References and how memory is managed had gotten a bit confusing in comparison to languages like C, which thankfully were compared and contrasted in this course.If anything my only complain would be that it is a bit short and I feel some things that could've gone more in depth were skipped with that feel of We'll look at this later you get from course but with that never happening, as well as the possibility of updating the course with newer Java versions in case something important was changed (Java 9, 10, 11).All in all though, I feel like I've learnt some insight on Java I did not know before and it cleared a lot of doubts I used to have, I'm pretty satisfied with the course!",4.5,2019-01-09T10:41:30Z,,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,,

1014442,Java Memory Management,12142070,Artem Kondratyev,"While most of the things are correct conceptually, the actual details of how things work under the hood are not exactly as explained which is confusing sometimes. Sometimes explanations are plain wrong.For example, when the new item is added to the stack, the ones that are added before are not really moving anywhere. Only the stack pointer is updated. This might seem insignificant, but this is actually why stack is so fast and efficient.Using unmodifiableCollection does not protect us from modifying Customer instances. Using CustomerReadOnly interface to avoid modifying the state of Customer instance is not an appropriate solution, in my opinion. I would say there is really no reason to make Customer mutable in the first place.Example explaining string immutability is irrelevant. String is immutable because it has no methods that modify its private state. The example is just re-assigning the reference to the string object, that would not change any object, mutable or not.The motivation for using heap is explained in a very confusing way. The code example illustrates re-using objects across different scopes by passing the reference of that object to another method. There is no reason why you would not be able to re-use the object should it still be allocated on the stack in that case.When the process finishes, all the memory used by the process is released. No, you don't need to re-start the computer if you have leaked some memory in the process. This is fundamentally incorrect statement. No, memory leak does not compromise the integrity of the computer it is running on, and it is not a horrible thing. It just means you will eventually run out of memory and will be forced to restart the process.With concurrent GC it's marking that is concurrent. You still need to pause all threads when compacting the heap, since your references on the stack needs to be updated. So it's the opposite to what the instructor says.",2.0,2017-12-27T09:36:57Z,,,,,True,True,,,,,True,,,,,,

However,  since Java 8 we have default methods in interfaces also, so what he said no longer holds. And when it come to spring framework, the bean configuration uses .xml file in the example.

I've taken multiple complete learn this language/multiple languages courses and they proceed to skip most of everything that makes it all useful. For example, OOP in a Java course is probably four videos; Inheritance, Composition, Polymorphism and Encapsulation which gives you something but is practically useless without perspective. It doesn't go past the fundamentals, it quickly fails in real world application.Also, the longer courses are and the more they promise, the lower the quality. They soon become generalist, grazing the top of something then moving on proceeding to give students a false sense of accomplishment which is why it sells. The flaw in this is students have invalid self worth, because they can't identify what they are missing. I thought I knew OOP with the four fundamentals; but I knew that it just didn't add up. I took this course and things are adding up, I'm finding that OOP is a specific way to map problems.Anyone can find the information online; the only good reason to buy courses is because it is of a higher quality which convenience/faster learning/good learning/efficiency = value.

I took off 1/2 star for technical reasons.  The author says the @ override is not needed and deletes it from the code several times.  Actually, the @ override makes the code more readable and safer because it immediately tells us that the method is inherited and is distinct from a method that's not inherited.  Methods that override other methods have certain restrictions--access modifiers, argument lists, return types, and more.  Without the @ override identification, a coder might not match the same number of patameters in the overriding method with the overridden method and break the code.

I must say that it accomplished in this aspect and that newcomers will have a lot to learn here.Pros:* Click by click tutorials so you cannot miss anything. You can learn a lot, how JEE is integrated with Eclipse* Forces you to type code along with the author.* Most examples are written from scratch.* First few chapters have good examples* Picture Squirrel is a very good practical example.Cons:* Course needs to be updated to the new technologies, fix code errors that appeared with upgrade to new java and tomcat. Database examples will benefit from try-with-resource statements* I am not sure if author has created these tutorials on the fly during some live broadcast, but he really needs to prepare before recording these courses. During some videos, he simply decides to switch design approaches that he took early on, thus making code obsolete that he wrote moments ago. I am all for intentional mistakes to prove some point, but design choices must be defined at the beginning and should not be deviated from.* Chapter 4 should provide more examples about given concepts. Some in-depth information about servlet, jsp and tomcat lifecycle would be helpful for course completeness.* Account example in database chapter could have been much better. Author decided to deviate from its well establish method of showing you everything from scratch and skip servlet related parts to show only database related parts. True, nothing here is something that we haven't already seen, but, for the sake of course completeness, should be there. At least, author should provide starting example of code on which he will add things that he presented.* There are no examples nor even mentions of Servlet listeners and filters!! 10 hour course should have at least mentioned them as they are commonly used and they are part of servlet specification.",3.0,2016-11-10T15:55:13Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,True,,,

There's no explanation of the way the technology operates behind the curtain, and there's no explanation of why we should use a servlet as opposed to a jsp.  The course is very heavy on the 'how' aspect, which works to get you up and running, but it really doesn't give me a firm understanding of why I'm actually doing things, I'm mainly just copying what Steve has put on the screen.  When trying to recreate the simple things shown here in other projects to reinforce what I've learned, I often have to reference the course content again because I didn't have any background information on what I was doing, so I didn't have a reference in my head as to what I needed to do.It's not a bad course, but it's definitely lacking on a lot of the detail I've come to expect from other online courses.",3.0,2015-05-26T11:14:28Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,True,,,

New students interested in programming for the very first time will be very well served by pace style and flow of these videos.  It starts with the very basics of programming; installing your tools, getting use to the programming environment, getting exposed to language syntax, primitive types, logic flow,  and all the introductory basics.For season programmers not familiar with, or struggling with Object Oriented programming paradigms,  this class will gently but thoroughly expose to your first early steps of using class, understanding encapsulation, coupling, cohesion and other OO buzzwords and techniques.  For experienced programmers (me), whose job responsibilities have taken them away for heavy involvement in direct programming, this class is a godsend for removing the rust and bring you up to speed on interfaces, abstract classes, and slowly opening the doors to design patterns, collections, and i.o. streams.

People who purchase this course please make use of it.Tutor has a tremendous knowledge on the concept. His way of explaining the concepts theoretically was more interesting and keeps us engaging. Tutor has done justice in theoretically explaining concepts but the course lacks real world examples with proper code break-up explanation justifying it. Existing coding sessions are done in a hurry bury way and highly doubt whether some one could follow it with the instructor.Sadly No source code available for the course to understand what is coded on screen and explained after watching the express fast coding session.Tutor should have made little more effort to explain the actual thin line difference between Locks , ReEntrant lock , Reentrant lock with trylock, ReentrantReadWrite Lock, Semaphores etc... and when to use it as it's bit confusing after taking up the course as the course never deals with real time examples as when to use what on what occasions.Disappointments & Expectations------------------------------------------------The main purpose to purchase this course is to clear my project multi-threading interview where I was not able to answer a very basic first question which is What are the Life-cycles of a thread. I managed with start, run, sleep which I am aware of. The reason why I am telling this here is to make the tutor add up and cover basic items too without skipping it as this course is all about Multi-threading Next my big expectation was Producer Consumer, Semaphores for which there is not even a single simple flavor of coding session done. This section was the prime area where our project revolves.There is no where the concept of Inter-Process communication brought up or explained in the course as there are no real world examples.From the knowledge level of nothing I improved myself to fair level with theoretical concepts not practically. Hope I will relate things to apply the theoretical knowledge in future.Last but not least to the Tutor as a target audience We expect and come to Udemy for courses to teach us practical knowledge and equip us which is missing in this course.Hope you correct that in your future courses.Thank you.",3.0,2018-12-01T21:25:15Z,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,

It tries to cover a lot of ground - and some of it is not even 'advanced' - and in order to do so, the instructor doesn't dig much into each subject.Sample code is incomplete, and I kept getting all sorts of errors (like  Establishing SSL connection without server's identity verification is not recommended. According to MySQL 5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+ requirements SSL connection must be established by default if explicit option isn't set.). If you need to double check each file to see if what is being shown is what is in the corresponding file, it would be easier to type it all in.Also, I rather the instructor used an IDE, which makes coding easier and faster. Eclipse gives all sorts of warnings ( e.g Node is a raw type. References to generic type Node<T> should be parameterized) to sample code, but he only addresses Eclipse in the last chapter.There hasn't been any responses to the questions posted for over a year, so I wouldn't expect to have my questions answered too. The author suggests in many lessons to look up the JavaDocs for the features we want to use, and maybe that is the best advice in the whole course: if you want to learn Java, use the free on-line documentation that Oracle provides.This course was a waste of time and money.",1.0,2016-08-30T07:59:35Z,,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,

28373,Advanced Java Programming,370180,James Raynard,"About a third of the material covers topics like generics and exceptions which should be covered in a basic Java course, while the advanced topics are only covered superficially. Important subjects like Swing and JDBC are only given 15-20 minutes of lectures each!So if the material in Advanced Java Programming isn't particularly advanced, how about the programming? Unfortunately, this is very much at the basic level, with baby examples written in a single class in the default package. Each subject is covered in isolation and there is no attempt to combine and consolidate previous topics to create more interesting (or even useful) programs. A couple of the examples are unnecessarily convoluted and there are a few which contain clear mistakes.There are also silent edits in some of the videos where the lecturer shows some code which contains an error but which runs smoothly. Then the lecturer returns to the code, where the error has been magically corrected. Meanwhile the student who has been typing along has spent a lot of time trying to work out why their identical code doesn't even compile.The lecturer does not appear to be active in the course forum, where students have asked a number of questions.All in all, rather a disappointing course.

28373,Advanced Java Programming,186918,Christopher Ford,"I came to this course having completed the Infinite Skills Java Basics course, which I found to be an excellent introduction to the language. I enjoyed the style of learning provided by Infinite Skills and Udemy and was keen to develop the skills that I learned in the first course.I found that the initial chapters in this course followed on well from the introductory course and I especially enjoyed the introduction to Swing and Java GUIs. However, from this point the course went down hill for me. The Swing introduction turned out to be just that: an introduction. In fact, the instructor went over a very basic set of Swing features and then promptly moved on to cover an entirely new topic. The Swing features were not used again.This problem plagues the second half of this course. Advanced topics are introduced, given the most basic explanation with very few lines of supporting code and then forgotten, never to be used again. The only exception to this rule is with Applets, which the instructor seems to use where Swing tools might be more appropriate. There is also no explanation of how to actually build applets into web pages which, it turns out, is a rather complicated feat in itself. Also, this course makes very little use of separate classes in the programs. I find this astonishing, given that Java is an Object Oriented Language with such an emphasis on class usage.There are some chapters on this course that I came out of with no greater understanding than I had when I went in. To this day, I have virtually no concept of what a Java Bean is and where I would want to use one.I appreciate that Java is a vast topic and it would take hours of video tutorial to cover everything in more detail. In reality however, when you are paying $99 for a course you would expect to get you money's worth. Extensive Java tutorial books are available for half the price of this course and go into significantly more depth.Ideally, this course should be split into two or even three courses. The first half of the course should be expanded on and placed into an intermediate course. There should be a greater emphasis on Swing development (because what applications are command-line based these days, realistically?)The second half of the course would be better if it were offered as a separate course going into significantly more detail than is available here and there are multiple improvements that could be taken into account on top of this.All in all, I do not consider that this course offers good value for money.

But people want to use JEE because it scales better and supplies better means to separate the layers (view, business logic, data). I had expected strategies and best practices - at least in an appendix. Apart from loosely following the MVC pattern the course does not give useful info on how to architecture a real world JEE application. Fittingly this course lacks e. g. the topics of Enterprise Java Beans and Context Dependency Injection, and also does not even roughly describe the other elements of the complex JEE standard. IMO a total fail!It should also be mentioned that IMO the presentation of the lessons is lousy: most of the time the instructor speaks way to fast, scrolls around to fast, lets the discussed code in eclipse be hidden in a too small frame, does not show graphical overviews but only text, code and speech... it is unnecessarily exhausting to follow. Sadly the instructor does not seem to answer to the questions of students...Why still a score of 2 stars?

How can a course on JEE7 not talk about JSF, JPA or JTA? I know those topic themselves deserve separate attention, but at least a good introduction could be done. Otherwise why would you label this as a 'Training Course'? How can it be demonstrated without using a proper application server? Even though Tomcat supports web development, that's not really an application server - it doesn't provide facilities like CMT. I thought of not wasting time on reviewing rest of the course, but I doubt if JNDI has been introduced here. I don't see web services being introduced, explanation of WSDL or SOAP. The Java Beans component architecture, connector architecture - nothing is here. You don't write a single EJB in a training course for JEE7!!

645792,Java Programming for Beginners: Become a Java Programmer,8461420,Francis Agyemang-Duah,"This instructor has great knowledge of the Java Programming Language. She speaks very clearly, and the homework helps you understand the material she is taking about. There is a lot of hands on exercise to help you understand each topic. Of course, very prompt in getting back to you with the answer to your inquiry.Finally, I think the instructor can add more content to make it a complete course. She could have expanded on topics such as The String Class, Wrapper Classes, etc.Overall, I think a novice like me has learnt a good deal from her course.",5.0,2017-07-29T05:06:19Z,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,

887006,Java Object-Oriented Programming : Build a Quiz Application,19864688,Roman Leca,"Fantastic material! This is one of the best explanation of Java basics I have seen. The instructor creates a problem, lets us feel and understand it, then shows how to deal with it. Look at how inheritance is explained, for example!What is disappointing is the speed he went with through the practical example. The code was already written, the problem already solved, so no really added value here. The real challenge is to understand how to define classes, objects and methods for real problems like the quiz here. I would love to see a real life example explained in exactly the same manner as theoretical notions:1. identify and explain the problem2. decide on the solution3. applyBut, overall, great work!",4.0,2018-08-21T13:04:11Z,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
